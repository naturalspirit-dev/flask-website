  <h2>Creating Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Extensions to Flask are regular Python packages.  But there are some
    rules you should/must follow so that we can enlist your extension on
    the Flask extension registry:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Your extension must be placed in a <code>flaskext.</code>
      namespace package.  This makes it easier for others to locate
      your extension and does not clutter the PyPI index with generic
      toplevel packages.
    <li>
      Your extension should have the word “Flask” in the name.  This
      makes it easier to locate all the packages that go well with
      Flask.  This is also how the moderators of the extension registry
      spot your extension.
    <li>
      The extension should be documented with Sphinx and it's recommended
      to use intersphinx to interlink the documentation with Flask itself
      and other extensions it might depend on.  It's also recommended to use
      the <a href="http://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sphinx-themes">Flask
      Sphinx Themes</a> or a modified version of one of them.
    <li>
      Extensions should have proper dependencies in the <em>setup.py</em>
      file specified so that installation with pip/easy_install works.
    <li>
      Ideally your extension has at least one example in the repository
      or tarball so that it's easier to understand how it works.
  </ol>
  <p>
    We scan the PyPI index in regular intervals for new Flask packages
    so your extension should sooner or later end up here.  If this is
    not quick enough for you, send <a
    href="mailto:armin.ronacher@active-4.com">me a mail</a>.
